This project investigates the development of machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals.

**Project Goal:**

* Build a model that accurately forecasts diabetes using medical attributes, aiding early detection and intervention.

**Data and Preprocessing:**

* The project utilizes the `diabetes.csv` dataset loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using functions like `head()`, `shape`, `describe()`, and value counts to understand data distribution and target variable imbalance.
* Data is standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure features are on the same scale.
* The target variable (`Outcome`) is separated from the features (`X`).

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

* Three models are trained and evaluated:
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel
    * Logistic Regression
    * Decision Tree Classifier
* Train-test split is performed with a 70/30 ratio for training and testing data, respectively. Stratification is used to maintain class balance in the split.
* Model performance is evaluated using accuracy score on both training and testing data.

**Key Findings:**

* The SVM classifier achieves the highest accuracy of 78.66% on the test data.

**Future Work:**

* Explore feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
* Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model selection.
* Consider using ensemble methods for potentially better predictions.
* Integrate the model into a user-friendly interface for real-world application.

**Dependencies:**

* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn (including svm, linear_model, metrics, model_selection)

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure the dependencies are installed.
2. Place the `diabetes.csv` file in the `dataset` folder.
3. Run the Python script to execute the analysis and prediction.

**Note:**

This project serves as a basic framework for diabetes prediction using machine learning. The accuracy can be further improved with additional data exploration and model optimization techniques.
